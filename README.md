## Abstract

The main objective of this project is to familiarize us with having a defined team and project structure, where the features are divided into different user stories and are assigned to different team members. With this we cultivate knowledge of working as a team while keeping an organized backlog. Not only that but also integration of QA and CI/CD methods that allow us to seamlessly have continuous integration and deployment.

Our product is called Restaurante Moles Ovos and aims to make communication between restaurant staff easier while also providing customers with information and booking options.
